# **VUWSA Lost And Found Database**

## **Welcome**

This document will cover the usage of the web application used to manage VUWSA's Lost And Found Database. This database is intended to replace the existing system of an Excel spreadsheet. It aims to improve ease-of-use and accessibility for both staff and students. For new users, please read the Tutorial below.

## **Tutorial**

Upon opening the web application, you will be presented with a home screen. On this screen is a sidebar containing "Home" and "Log In" buttons, a search bar at the top of the website and social media links at the footer.  

### **Tiers Of Access**

There are three different tiers of access - Student, Receptionist and Admin. Students can use the "Search" function, but it now show specific item information, rather showing the number of items similar to or matching their search query. They can also use category search to further refine their query, but again, no details about items will be displayed. This is for security reasons, to prevent people from being able to find details of an item that is not theirs and then going to claim it.

### **Logging In**

Many of the functions of the database are disabled unless the user is logged in. This is to prevent misuse of the database and to ensure that only authenticated VUWSA workers can access details of lost items. However, students can still search for items and be returned with general results that can further be investigated at VUWSA's offices.

### **Search**

The search function operates by the user specifying key words in the search bar. Results are returned based on whether these keywords match up with items in the database. Search results can then be narrowed through the use of categories presented after the initial search.

### **Viewing All Items**

It is possible to view all items in the database by clicking the "View All Items" button. 

### **Adding An Item**

### **Removing An Item**
